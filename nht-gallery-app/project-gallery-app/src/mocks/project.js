Consumers consistently rank outdoor spaces as one of their most desired benefits, both at the home and master plan level.  These spaces do not have to be cost prohibitive as we will show.  What is necessary is that they take the available space and design it in such a way as to enhance the merchandising of the product - be it a home, a neighborhood or a community - drawing visitors into wanting to become a part of it.  \r\nWell executed outdoor spaces can turn the ordinary into the extraordinary as seen in this home at Avignon in Irvine, CA.  Standard Pacific and PDI Design Associates have stunningly designed and merchandised this wrap around outdoor room, opening up the family space to the environment and expanding the usable space for day-to-day living or entertainment.

        'Today\'s consumers want more...for less.  As of February 2015 almost half of new home shoppers indicated they are making a move because they want their next home to be "larger in size," yet they want something affordable.   Do they want size or function?  Our consumer research points to function first as 72% of new home shoppers surveyed shared they were looking for "more function over size". What is the solution?  This month`s DesignLens Special Feature focuses on Micro Housing.  We hope  to inspire all of you to design creative solutions with better spaces and more function in the home.  There is a resurgence towards homes with less than 1,000 square feet due to affordability, technology, and the need to simplify our lives in today`s fast-paced society.

Some guiding factors for the elevation included the importance of brick in the Brambleton masterplan and the multicultural buyers` preference for more traditional homes. Of interest, the builder elected to go with just one plan for 49 units, but with five elevations and multiple interior options to expand the marketability.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>After starting as custom lots, the site was eventually adjusted to high-end production and Vista Dorado was born. Shea wanted to keep a more custom feel to the special site, so embarked on what is probably their most intense design efforts to date. The Shea team worked with Bassenian Lagoni Architects to create the six floor plans. Between three elevations per plan and color scheme variations, each home in the community is its own unique combination. While the community caters to a more traditional buyer in a suburban setting, Shea wanted the architecture to feel new and fresh. Considering traditional styles as well as regional influences, the design team decided on three strong elevation styles: Formal Spanish, French Manor, and one they call Napa.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>The Great Park neighborhoods are located on the site of the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, a decommissioned naval air base. A large portion of the base has been developed into the Great Park, consisting of approximately 1,300 acres of open space and public amenities. These include a world-class sports park, an arts complex, a farm + food lab, the Great Park Balloon, and a future 12,000-seat amphitheater. In addition, 20 miles of bike trails connect Great Park homeowners to the City of Irvine`s 54 miles of off-street bike trails linked to Orange County`s 1,000 miles of bicycle pathways. Neighborhoods will be integrated around the Great Park. Parasol Park is the third of these neighborhoods and has direct access to the Great Park as well as a future retail center.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>EYA jumped at the opportunity to build on this site, since it offered a rare chance to create a walkable neighborhood with access to retail, as well as the future Purple Line metro stop. The neighborhood is a short drive to Downtown Bethesda, as well as two major shopping centers.</p>\r\n",

        "<p>Pardee Homes worked with Bassenian Lagoni Architects to create the Irving Gill-inspired architecture. Bassenian Lagoni found inspiration in the local San Diego architecture designed by architect Irving John Gill and added a modern spin to it, which created the unique elevations seen in the models.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>Vive is a redesign of Vue, which was previously featured on DesignLens in January 2015. DesignLens felt this revamped collection was worth featuring due to the strategic changes based on homeowner feedback. The collection went from four floor plans down to two. Infinity found that buyers kept wanting the biggest plans at Vue, so they made the two plans similar sizes with different layouts to segment the buyers. Infinity Home Collection worked with Woodley Architectural Group, who designed the original Vue, to create Vive.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>Toll worked with KTGY Group to create a trio of distinctly contemporary styles based on the desert environment. The unique architecture is both a reason why people are buying and also why they are not.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>Sobel Co. worked with AW Architects to design the townhomes. The design team took inspiration from the idea of an Italian village with pedestrian walkways and gathering places. This inspiration led to strong Mediterranean architecture and also influenced the land plan. The model complex landscaping is so heavy that it hides the elevations and is somewhat deceptive in that the driveways and garage doors are not shown.</p>\r\n",

These principles look beyond amenities and consider the bigger wants and needs of residents from forward-thinking planning to partnerships with lifestyle managers.</p>\r\n",
        '<p>When Berkeley Homes got the chance to build in RidgeGate again, they jumped at the opportunity. They previously built NorthSky, a single-family detached neighborhood, which was featured in the March 2015 edition of DesignLens. This plot of land had a more urban feel due to its proximity to retail and the Lone Tree Arts Center, so Berkeley wanted to create a more urban product. Godden Sudik Architects worked with the builder to create what they are calling "contemporary detached brownstones."</p>\r\n',
        "<p>Thrive worked with Pel-Ona Architects &amp; Urbanists, a local Boulder architect, to design Vita, which is based on the older Solaris Collection by Thrive. With the new neighborhood of Beeler Park opening and the roll out of the new name and branding for Thrive (previously known as New Town Builders), the company wanted to have a new showcase design for their bread and butter product, the first-time move-up family home. Vita is the result.</p>\r\n",
        '<p>Artesana\'s story is all about creativity and how design is key to the success of a project. When TRI Pointe bought Pardee, they allowed the newly acquired company to start designing product on the division level versus all at corporate. This brought about a paradigm shift for Pardee Homes and the brand now has a strong design focus. Artesana was Pardee Homes-San Diego`s "coming out party" for their new design-centric philosophy.</p>\r\n',
        "<p>The concept for the for-sale homes came from the owner of Monte Hewett Homes bumping into past buyers and hearing how they wanted to downsize, but they couldn`t find what they were looking for in Alpharetta. The buyers wanted a walkable lifestyle and low maintenance homes, but they had dogs and needed ground floor outdoor space. The design team came up with seven different low maintenance products that targeted empty nesters that includes detached and attached opportunities. Due to the location in the Avalon community, the design team created more contemporary/urban architecture to work with the look of the nearby retail and apartments. The Mansell townhomes are located in gray on the upper right portion of the site plan and is the closest product to the town center.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>CC Homes worked with Sotolongo Salman Henderson Architects to design the homes. Since the collection includes five floor plans with three elevation styles each, Capistrano Estate has a very diverse streetscene. The three elevation styles featured are Mediterranean (comes standard on all homes), Old Florida (an upgraded look that is inspired by Key West), and Tuscan (another upgraded look). The Mediterranean, which is included at no extra cost, is the most popular. The only plan modeled for this collection is the Briones.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>The New Home Company worked with Bassenian Lagoni Architects to create these contemporary duplexes. Notice how the design team created the look of a flat roof without using flat roofs, hopefully minimizing maintenance issues in the future. Cobalt is one of two attainable products that The New Home Company designed for the Esencia masterplan. The builder wanted to offer something for first-time buyers and young families in the expensive Orange County market. Azure, the other attainable product, will be featured on DesignLens later this year.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>As is so often the case with infill sites, McKinley Village had its challenges including entitlement issues, neighborhood push back, and problematic features bordering the site. One side of the approximately 50-acre site is bordered by Union Pacific railroad tracks and the other side is bordered by I-80, which is a major freeway in Sacramento.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>Drees Homes went into Willowsford wanting to be different versus just another builder in the mix of the 22 models from their competitors. The key differentiators for the series are that Drees is willing to customize floor plans, the architecture, and the outdoor living spaces. Drees also went into the masterplan with aggressive prices in the high $800,000s, but the builder actually achieves an average sales price of $1.28 million.</p>\r\n",

This surban community targets a wide variety of consumers due to the many assets of the site like the good nearby schools and proximity to the Metro and retail. Many of the buyers have been empty nesters who are downsizing from larger detached homes and are looking for lower maintenance living.</p>\r\n",

LandWell came back to the land in 2011 and started creating infrastructure in 2013. The smaller site plan on the left is a slightly rotated version of the core multigenerational component of Cadence, while the site plan on the right is the full community, which includes Lennar`s 55+ community up at the upper left.</p>\r\n",

The design team focused on insulating the homes from the railroad noise, as well as designing the homes to offset the presence of the tracks.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>Altair is a guard-gated community set on a hilltop in Irvine. Toll Brothers partnered with Lennar to develop the ten neighborhoods, which all integrate modern design elements.

        "<p>Monarch Dunes has 30 holes of golf, and Shea planned to build another course, but instead the staff challenged themselves to create something different. With a nod to the Central California location and nearby wineries, they elected to develop 48 acres of vineyards, with more planned in the future. The masterplan has had a wine program for years, partnering with a local wine maker to create their own blend, but now that Monarch Dunes has its own vineyards, they are able to do it all in-house. In response to this new addition, Shea worked with Bassenian Lagoni Architects to create a collection inspired by the new vineyards and to create homes that relate thematically to a vineyard lifestyle. Shea wanted the homes to be larger and designed for entertainment so buyers could have the single-level living without giving up their spacious homes to entertain in. The homes have views and great indoor/outdoor connectivity as well.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>Vu is on a 38-acre site located in a master-planned golf course community nestled against the McCullough Mountains. The prime attribute of the site is the view of the valley, golf course, and city lights. Christopher Homes wanted most, if not all of the homes, to enjoy the view. Once they determined they were going to design the community around the views, they needed to figure out the type of home. The community design needed to balance maximizing the views with still having enough homes to make the deal pencil.</p>\r\n",
        "<p>K. Hovnanian worked with their in-house team and D33 to design the homes. The modern elevations are nicely executed with clean lines and diverse massing. Color and materials also play an important role to enhance the exteriors.</p>\r\n",

        "<p>Adero Canyon is a mix of single and upside down two-story plans designed by RFT Design. The design team was inspired by the site itself. They knew they did not want to overwhelm the site, but instead preserve the natural beauty, so they created homes that mesh with their surroundings. The two models represent the two distinctly unique floor plan types in the community, each with their own unique story and sales reception. The Parker, which is the single-story model, is the top seller in the community; while the Sullivan, which is the two-story home, has struggled with sales, despite having a dramatic, award-winning design. Both plans reflect great design and each offers lessons to be learned.</p>\r\n",

After working with David Court of The Blackline Studio, their long-time architectural partner, they came up with the Approach Collection. Stapleton did not have a single-story duplex product and no product in those square footage ranges. This product filled a niche, so CreekStone earned a spot in the Beeler Park neighborhood. While not to everyone`s taste, the modern elevation of the models fits well into the eclectic mix of the Stapleton products with its varying roof lines and mix of materials.</p>\r\n",

During the recovery, Pardee had to rethink the concept for Aliento and redesign it for today`s buyers and today`s prices. The builder reviewed all areas and reduced product square footage, as well as updated the amenity plan for new buyers` tastes. Pardee kept the community gated as it was originally planned and created a masterplan that is premium in brand but family in nature. Aliento will include 500 homes at build-out, including a 55+ neighborhood within the larger community. Aliento is in a great location near the freeway and retail, as well as near one of the best elementary schools in the district.

The developer then used the existing employment base to create a walkable, well-designed community focused on neighborhood, health, wellness, art, and technology, almost mirroring the type of industry clusters at the masterplan. Lake NonaвЂ™s success started with the developerвЂ™s focus on attracting health services industries.

        "Highland Homes worked with their in-house architecture team to create these plans to fill a need in the Houston market for more affordable housing. Highland's challenge in creating this new narrow, smaller product was to do the quality Highland is known for in a narrower product. They were also challenged to include two-car garages without the garage taking over the streetscene and accommodating single story and master down plans on such a narrow lot. Highland's architecture team tackled all of the challenges and created beautiful, open floor plans in a series that includes single story, master down, and two-story master up plans. The team strategically chose the craftsman and cottage elevation styles of the series to help offset the dominant garages. Thoughtful material and color choices further enhance the elevations. Highland also varied the garages by either making them flush with the front of the home or set back into the plan to minimize the impact. The Windermere is the only plan modeled of the series.",

This home has found success on multiple fronts: award winning for its design and top selling. Originally, the design team went all out with the plans for this collection with lots of bells and whistles. Pardee always does an interim step before finalizing their floor plans, where they run them past their contractors for feedback. Based on the feedback (about build costs or what they would or would not get paid for in the market), the beautiful final plans for the collection were created. While they are still high end, the collection is more strategic about its detailing, including features where the luxury really made an impact. The garage in this model is being used for the sales office, hence the tinted glass doors.",
        "The tour begins with the Cimarron, which is a close second to being the top-selling plan. The home is modeled in the Modern Farmhouse style with a gabled roof line, a mix of siding, and charming awnings over many of the windows. The sales office is located in the garage for this model.",
        "Creating a diverse street scene within a single-style community can sometimes be a challenge, but the design team rose to the occasion. The team created a mix of elevations that all fall under the modern umbrella but have their own personalities. The three models highlight the three different variations on the modern style, including mid-century modern, classic modern, and Desert Modern. The tour begins with Plan 1, which features a more mid-century modern-inspired elevation. This is the top-selling plan in the community.",

The Citizens Housing and Planning Council estimated that 56 % of New York City dwellers live alone.  Looking to solve the city`s current housing crisis mayor Mike Bloomberg waived the 400-square-foot size requirement and opened a competition for the best small unit solution.  The motivation was the belief that the creation of more micro-apartments designed to meet the needs of singles would provide more opportunities to families as two- to four-bedroom apartments would open up and this would eventually bring down rent prices across the city.  Another perception is that the price of larger apartments is artificially high as multiple singles, who together have combined incomes greater than families, look for larger apartments to share with others.

        "Residence 2 is 2,157 square feet with 3 to 4 bedrooms, 2.5 to 3 baths, and a 2-car garage. The 38-foot-wide model features the optional ground-floor bedroom and full bath, which takes the bed and bath counts up to 4 and 3, respectively.",
        "Due to the layout of the cluster, the design team was challenged by the Crescendo elevation. They came to a charming solution: the Crescendo has two elevation style options, and within a cluster the two Crescendo plans always have different elevations. This differentiation allows for individuality between the homes, even when they are connected and the same plan.",

        "The basement bedroom would work well for guests or even a multigenerational situation, especially with the wet bar that can support simple kitchen functions.",
        "While the roof deck is very cool, it has not had a huge take rate with buyers. Views are wonderful from the ground floor of the home and the upgrade is expensive, so many buyers are electing to put their money into other upgrades like the stacking doors to further connect with the outdoors versus this space.",
        "The saltwater pool has lap lanes, a zero-entry area, a slide, and a splash zone. ",

This 18-foot-wide, three-story home has 4 bedrooms, 3.5 baths, and a 1-car garage. Since the home only has a single-car garage, the entry is more defined and provides direct access to the ground floor living areas. This home is always an interior unit. ",

        "The Berkeley is 2,005 square feet with 3 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, and a detached 2-car garage. A highlight of this home is the multiple storage opportunities scattered around the home including the linen cabinet near the powder room and a large storage closet off the valet.",
        "The outdoor living space that runs along the back of the home is large enough to accommodate multiple gathering areas. Note how the design team merchandised the area to highlight the opportunities for seating as well as alfresco dining.",
        "Laundry rooms are a feature consumers are looking for and will pay a premium for. The design team added some interest to the space with the choice of tile in the backsplash and the floor.",
        "The Reflection Collection includes two additional floor plans that were not modeled. The Morning Mist plan is the smallest in the collection at 2,369 square feet. This 50-foot wide, single-story home can have up to 4 bedrooms, up to 4 baths, and a 3-bay tandem garage. Like the other plans, this home can include an optional finished basement which increases the square footage to 3,558.",
        "What is called out as a “tech” niche on the floor plan has been outfitted as a butler’s pantry of sorts with cabinetry and a wine fridge by Chameleon Design. This setup helps to highlight the entertaining opportunities of the home.",
        "The ground floor also includes an optional second rec room or bedroom. The team elected to highlight the additional rec space and TRIO created an exercise room complete with mats for yoga and a ballet bar for barre workouts. Way to think beyond the traditional bike or treadmill. Since the basement is a walkout, both rooms benefit from full versus egress windows that fill the space with light.",
        "Skylar at Valencia by Toll Brothers has a two-story great room with large clerestory windows that connect to the stacked, second story deck. The modern light fixture and floor-to-ceiling fireplace emphasize just how grand this space is.  ",
        "All the secondary bedrooms share a bathroom accessed off the hallway. Like the secondary bathroom in Plan 1, this one is also set up to easily be shared with a separate sink area and toilet/shower area. Thoughtful designs like this go a long way for buyers to see themselves in the home.",
        "The great room groups together the main living areas in an open layout. Two-story volume soars over the family room before dropping down above…",
        "The covered patio gives renters their own slice of private outdoor living. All ten Crescendo plans at Bri face the courtyards, connecting them to the beautifully designed community hubs.",
        "<p><em>The Allen primary bedroom</em></p>\r\n",

        "The suite has an open studio layout and comes standard with a kitchenette and full bathroom. This space could work for a guest or roommate, along with a more permanent resident like an elderly parent. The fact that the team elected to standardly a suite like this in two homes shows how much multigenerational suites have increased in popularity over the last couple of years and are finding their way into a wide variety of offerings from attached to small lot detached to larger luxury homes. Not every home should include a suite like this, but as you plan your next collection, do your research, and see if a suite might at least be a smart option to offer.",

Slight variations in floor plans help appeal to renters with different preferences. While the previous floor plan appeals to someone with a more minimal lifestyle, this plan appeals to someone who might enjoy cooking or is bringing more items from their previous residence and needs extra space or storage.",
        "The team thoughtfully designed the homes to provide great function. Instead of keeping the stairwell open and running the railing along the full staircase, the team chose to add a wall along most of the stairs and only add a short amount of railing at the end. This choice provides the ability to better furnish the seating area, while still defining the staircase.",
        "The Kayak Club fronts a water feature and showcases beautiful architecture and a welcoming entry. The plentiful windows bring the outside in or, in this image, reveal the warm lighting in the interior, which encourages people to visit. Not only does the community have a wide range of amenities, but it also has a full lifestyle event calendar.",
        "Every Tri Pointe home can also be equipped with a HomeSmart® package, which includes a Mesh Wi-Fi system, a smart thermostat, a smart garage door opener, and more. ",
        "With a beer garden and mini-golf in the summer and an outdoor ice-skating rink in the winter, Denver’s Skyline Park puts a lot of family-friendly activities into the middle of downtown. Because this neighborhood is home to the highest point in the Easton Park community, it only seemed appropriate to name it after a park in the Mile-High City. When complete, the views from the 21-acre flagship park will give Knob Hill Park a run for its money.",

        "Another benefit that small homes provide is offering solutions in addressing the needs of the homeless or those suffering from economic set-backs.  The economy, cost of real estate, and need for housing created the community of Quixote Village, in the city of Olympia, WA to be envisioned.  The concept was derived from a mobile tent camp which would set up in parking lots of host churches.  A non-profit organization, composed of interfaith leaders, was able to fulfill the residents` vision of a permanent site providing homes sized at only 144 square feet adjacent to a large community building. Residents participated in the design of their home and choose larger porches instead of more interior space.  They also requested that the homes be shaped in a horseshoe configuration to facilitate a community atmosphere. The community building, which contains bathing facilities, kitchen, laundry, and social spaces, is an important feature in the day to day life at the Village.  Costs to build was less than other affordable housing projects and the single family detached product provided residents with a sense of pride and independence. The benefit of this type of community is that vacant lots can be developed as urban infill and these tiny house communities offer residents a private home and supportive community, while providing a transition towards self-sufficiency.
